# Nifty 50 Chaos Theory Prediction

This project demonstrates how to use chaos theory to predict the impact of changes in the Nifty 50 index on its high-weightage stocks.

## Overview

Chaos theory is a branch of mathematics focused on the behavior of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. In this project, we use chaos theory concepts to predict whether the Nifty 50 index will go up or down and how this will affect its high-weightage stocks.
